# Digital-Library

## Description
Digital-Library is a web application that allows users to manage and search for books in a digital format. Users can add, search, and view details about various books. This project is designed to practice components, props, state, and events in React, working with dynamic data displayed using React components, controlled forms for user input, and conditional rendering.

## Requirements
For this project, you must:
- Display a dynamic list of books.
- Implement a form for users to add new books to the list.
- Add a search bar to filter books by title or genre.
- Write a well-structured README file.

## Initial Data
Store this array of book objects in your application as your starting dataset:
```javascript
const initialBooks = [
  { id: 1, title: "The Great Gatsby", author: "F. Scott Fitzgerald", genre: "Classic" },
  { id: 2, title: "1984", author: "George Orwell", genre: "Dystopian" },
  { id: 3, title: "To Kill a Mockingbird", author: "Harper Lee", genre: "Classic" }
];
```

## Core Deliverables
As a user, I can:
- View a list of books with their titles, authors, and genres displayed.
- Add a new book to the library using a form. The form should capture the book's title, author, and genre.
- Filter books by typing into a search bar. The search should update dynamically and display only books matching the search term in the title or genre.


## Project Setup
1. Create a new project folder.
2. Initialize a new React app.
3. Create a new GitHub repository (Ensure it is private) and add your TM as a contributor for grading purposes.
4. Commit your work regularly and write clear commit messages.

## Guidelines for Submission
- Ensure your application runs without errors.
- Your code should be clean, well-organized, and appropriately commented.
- Provide a detailed README that includes:
  - A description of the project.
  - Instructions on how to run the app.
  - A list of features implemented.
  - Screenshots of the app (if possible).
- Ensure you have at least 20 commits.
